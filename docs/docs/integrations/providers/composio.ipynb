    "# Composio\n",
    "\n",
    "[Composio](https://composio.dev/) enables your AI agents to connect with 3000+ external applications and services through a unified interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Composio is the fastest way to enable your AI agents to take real-world actions—without dealing with individual API integrations, authentication flows, or complex tool formatting.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Access 3000+ tools** out of the box across popular apps like Slack, GitHub, Notion, and more.\n",
    "> * **Enforce strict access and data controls** with fine-grained permissions for each tool and user.\n",
    "> * **Trigger agents and workflows** using external events (e.g., new message in Slack, new issue in GitHub).\n",
    "> * **Customize tools** for your proprietary APIs or internal functions via modifiers.\n",
    "> * **Integrate seamlessly** with frameworks like OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, Vercel AI SDK, and more.\n",
    "> * **Enhance reliability** with input/output processing hooks to clean or transform data on the fly.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> No more writing dozens of bespoke integrations. Composio handles auth, tool normalization, and execution—so your agents can focus on reasoning, not plumbing.\n",

    "## Quick Start\n",
    "\n",
    "The Composio integration follows a simple 3-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discover and Add Tools** - Choose from 3000+ available tools\n",
    "2. **Authentication** - Secure, user-specific authentication with fine-grained controls\n",
    "3. **Tool Execution** - Execute tools through your preferred LLM provider\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Quick setup\n",
    "from composio import Composio\n",
    "\n",
    "composio = Composio()\n",
    "# Authenticate a toolkit\n",
    "connection_request = composio.toolkits.authorize(\n",
    "    user_id=\"user@email.com\", \n",
    "    toolkit=\"gmail\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "# Fetch and use tools\n",
    "tools = composio.tools.get(user_id=\"user@email.com\", toolkits=[\"GMAIL\"])\n",
    "```"
